//! \brief The implementation of the Chip Power Monitor.

//! The purpose of this application is to monitor the activity of the other CPU
//! cores on the chip on which it runs. It does this using the SpiNNaker System
//! Controller, enabling it to run with just the overhead due to using a core;
//! it does _not_ change the individual performance of the other cores on the
//! chip.
