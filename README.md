This package provides functionality which are common to front ends that
translate application level programs into executables which run on a SpiNNaker
machine.

Requirements
============

In addition to a standard Python installation, this package depends on:

    six
    enum34
    numpy
    SpiNNUtilities
    DataSpecification
    PACMAN
    SpiNNMan
    SpiNNMachine

These dependencies can be installed using `pip`:

    pip install six
    pip install enum34
    pip install numpy
    pip install SpiNNUtilities
    pip install DataSpecification
    pip install PACMAN
    pip install SpiNNMan
    pip install SpiNNMachine
    pip install SpiNNFrontEndCommon

If you want to use the `spinnaker_router_provenance_mapper` command line tool
to visualise the traffic on SpiNNaker boards caused by your simulations, you
should modify that last line to:

    pip install "SpiNNFrontEndCommon[plotting]"

This will additionally install `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to do the actual
plotting, as well as configuring the script.

Visualising SpiNNaker Board Network Traffic
===========================================

To get plots of the traffic in your simulation, use the
`spinnaker_router_provenance_mapper` command line tool (installed as described
above), passing in the name of a provenance database (usually called
`provenance.sqlite3` and created within the run's reporting folders) that
contains the raw data. This will produce a number of graphs as images in your
current directory; _those have fixed file-names._

An example of the sort of map that might be produced is:

![External_P2P_Packets](.images/External_P2P_Packets.png)

The P2P traffic being mapped is mainly used for system boot and control.
The white square is due to a chip on that SpiNNaker board being marked as
deactivated.

Installing NumPy on Older Systems
=================================
_Note that this part is not normally required on newer systems,_
where `numpy` installs inside a virtual environment just fine.

If you are using `virtualenv`, please also follow the instructions below to
install `numpy`. Further instructions for adding this global package to your
`virutalenv` are detailed in the "_User Installation_" and
"_Developer Installation_" sections below.

Ubuntu Linux
------------
Execute the following to install both `gtk` and `pygtk`:

    sudo apt-get install python-numpy

Fedora Linux
------------
Execute the following to install both `gtk` and `pygtk`:

    sudo yum install numpy

Windows 7/8 64-bit
------------------
Download and install http://spinnaker.cs.manchester.ac.uk/.../numpy-MKL-1.8.1.win-amd64-py2.7.exe

Windows 7/8 32-bit
------------------
Download and install http://spinnaker.cs.manchester.ac.uk/.../numpy-MKL-1.8.1.win32-py2.7.exe
