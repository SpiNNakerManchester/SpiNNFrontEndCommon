[Logging]
# ------
# Logging levels are as specified for the Python logging module.
# Listing a module below overrides the default logging level for that module
# and its children (unless they are also overridden).
#
# e.g., the following sample would set the default level to info, but display
# debug messages for pacman103.front.pynn, and only display warning messages
# for pacman.core
#
#     default = info
#     debug = front.pynn
#     info =
#     warning = core
#     error =
#     critical =
#
# The ```instantiate``` option determines whether front-ends set up loggers.
# If ```instantiate``` is True then users do not need to set up their own
# loggers.  If it is False, then users need to instantiate a logger at the top
# of each script, this is simply achieved by inserting the following lines at
# the top of the file.
#
#    include logging
#    logger = logging.basicConfig()
#

# Note log levels set above does not change the log message reported at the
# end of the run
